## Fix the Error

Notice the string entered in script on right.  Try running in the iPython shell by highlighting and pressing Ctrl-Enter:

Think about the type of error message you received.

*** =instructions
- Fix the error
- Press Submit Answer

*** =hint
- With syntax errors, look for mismatched "", '', or ()
- With runtime errors, look for mis-spelled words as Python needs exact match

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Correct the syntax error below
prnt("Here we go again!!!"

```

*** =solution
```{python}
# Correct the syntax error below
print("Here we go again!!!")
```

*** =sct
```{python}
# SCT written with pythonwhat: https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

test_output_contains("Here we go again!!!", pattern=False, no_output_msg = "Take a look at the instructions and try again")

success_msg("Nice job; another string that needed a missing ) and a mis-spelled print.")

```

## Try Something New

Take a look at the code below.  Try running it in the iPython shell.

*print(4/0)*

What type of error occurs?  Can you explain what caused this error?


*** =instructions
- Syntax error, did not follow Python rules
- Runtime error, followed the rules but something else was wrong when I ran it
- Semantic error, everything worked but not what I was expecting

*** =hint
- With runtime errors, look for bad direction to computer.  See if the instruction you gave is even possible.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =sct
```{python}
# SCT written with pythonwhat: https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

msg_bad = "That is not correct."
msg_success = "Exactly! This runtime error was caused by telling the computer to divide by zero; something we know is not possible.  In programs, divide by zero can be more subtle than this.  Now you know what the error looks like, and what to look for when it does occur."
test_mc(2, [msg_bad, msg_success, msg_bad])

```

## Try Something New Take 2

Take a look at the code below.  Try running it in the iPython shell.

*print(1,000,000)*

What type of error occurs?  Can you explain what caused this error?


*** =instructions
- Syntax error, did not follow Python rules
- Runtime error, followed the rules but something else was wrong when I ran it
- Semantic error, everything worked but not what I was expecting

*** =hint
- No error message?  So is the code doing what you expected?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =sct
```{python}
# SCT written with pythonwhat: https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

msg_bad = "That is not correct."
msg_success = "Correct!!  No error messages occurred because we followed the rules, and no impossible direction was given.  Unfortunately, we were not expecting 3 numbers.  We inadvertantly created a *tuple* in Python.  Even without () around the 3 numbers, separating by commas tells Python this is a *tuple*."
test_mc(3, [msg_bad, msg_bad, msg_success])

```

## Will This Work?

You have been asked to calculate the sum of a long list of numbers: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 22, 28, 34

- Is this result expected?  If not, fix the calculation
- Press Submit Answer
 

*** =hint
- Look at the original instructions
- Check the values indicated and carefully validate against what was entered.

## Fix the Error (2)

Notice the string entered in script on right.  Try running in the iPython shell by highlighting and pressing Ctrl-Enter:

Think about the type of error message you received.

*** =instructions
- Run the command and look at error output
- Try switching the order of variable name and value

*** =hint
- Check the order of variable and expression in your assignment statement

## Operation Shortcuts

Take a look at the code below.  Try running it in the iPython shell.

*a = b = 5*


*c = b + 2*


*b += 2*

What are the values of *a*, *b*, and *c* once run?


*** =instructions
- *a* is 5, *b* is 5, *c* is 7
- *a* is 5, *b* is 7, *c* is 7
- *a* is 5, *b* is 5, *c* is 5
- *a* is 5, *b* is 5, *c* is 5

*** =hint
- Try using print() for each variable to see current value

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =sct
```{python}
# SCT written with pythonwhat: https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

msg_bad = "That is not correct."
msg_success = "Correct!!  The first assignment statement sets up both *a* and *b*, the second creates *c* with current value of *b* + 2, and the third adds 2 to *b* with short hand version of *b = b + 2*.  Similar shorthand can be used for other arithmetic operations."

## Fix the Error (4)

Notice the string entered in script on right.  You are asked to write a program to sum the numbers from 10 to 20, take the average of those numbers, multiply the average by 3.2, add to 1000, and print the integer remainder when divided by 100.  The script on the right was created, but provides the wrong result.  

Think about the requirements and the result.  Fix the error(s).

*** =instructions
- Fix the problem with the script.
- Press Submit Answer

*** =hint
- Check the instructions, consider what the individual steps are that are needed.  
- Check each step one at a time for accuracy related to the calculation.
